    """
    Implementation of the Gait Sequence Detection algorithm by Hickey et al. (2017) [1], adapted and fine-tuned for wrist-worn accelerometer data.

    The algorithm detects periods of walking by analyzing the norm of acceleration signals.
    It assumes higher variability in the acceleration norm during movement compared to still periods.
    The present version (wrist) uses the norm of the acceleration with a similar rationale than the lower back.
    However, the upright threshold is used as maximum activity threshold for the wrist rather than an upright threshold.
    This threshold is derived from identifying the 95th percentile of the signal from walking bouts in a sample of 108 participants with diverse conditions.



    [1] Hickey, A., Del Din, S., Rochester, L., & Godfrey, A. (2017).
    Detecting free-living steps and walking bouts: validating an algorithm for macro gait analysis.
    Physiological measurement, 38(1), N1-N15.

    Notes:
    - Acceleration is preprocessed by removing gravity and calculating the norm of all three axes.
    - Thresholds for stillness and activity are based on empirical data from a diverse sample.
    - The algorithm operates on resampled data (default 100 Hz), hence it can be considered sample rate agnostic.
    - Continuous walking bouts can optionally be merged if separated by short breaks (≤3s).
